            <div class="second-content">
                <p class="content-first">Older adults want to play active and meaningful roles in their lives, including
                    as part of a social network, a neighborhood, and a community. Service providers and policymakers
                    must consider that a lack of sense of purpose can become problematic as people age. Engaging them in
                    leisure activities and volunteer work is important.</p>
                <p class="content-second">Older adults want to stay active and contribute to society in a reciprocal
                    manner (meaning that they want to exchange their services and skills with others for the mutual
                    benefit of the neighborhood or community). Qualitative and quantitative studies published from 2005
                    to 2016 examining the social needs of older adults were eligible for inclusion.</p>
                <p class="content-third">To stimulate social contacts, neighborhood initiatives can be developed. Social
                    meeting places, such as pubs and churches can help to foster the development of close and peripheral
                    relationships.</p>

            I have been caring for my mom & dad off and on for about 10 years now, and I know the importance of me being
            there for appointments. Older people need attention, love and care that they truly deserve.

        <h2><span>WE</span> CAN ORGANIZE EVERYTHING</h2>
        <p><strong>Interventions</strong> should focus on older adult’s desire for connectedness, participation and
            independence.</p>
        <p>Loneliness and social isolation are growing public health concerns in our aging society. Whilst these
            experiences occur across the life span, 50% of individuals aged over 60 are at risk of social isolation and
            one-third will experience some degree of loneliness later in life. It is vital to reduce loneliness and
            social isolation among older adults.</p>
        <p>The methodology framework proposed by Asked and O’Malley and further developed by Levac, et al. was used to
            guide the scoping review process. A total of 33 reviews met the inclusion criteria, evaluating a range of
            interventions targeted at older people residing in the community or institutionalised settings. </p>
